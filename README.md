# Spotify-data-analysis

Music has been a part of human culture for thousands of years and has played an imporatant role in many aspecs of society, including religion,entertainment and communication.  In my simple projects ,I tried to find out which musician and song is getting more public attraction and also the songs which are most listened by the spotify users.
